This program can be used as a benchmarking framework for your kernels.
You can make use of tools like IACA and Likwid quickly.

To add - or modify - a kernel you should: 
(1) In kernels.h:
	(a) you should add a name for your kernel under "modification point 1". 
	This will be used later for switching between all the kernels you want 
	to benchmark.
	(b) Define your kernel at "modification point 2".
(2) duplicate one of the <kernel.c> files - e.g striad.c or vtriad.c - and 
modify the modification points 1 and 2 to meet your needs.
(3) In main.c:
	(a) "modification point 1": to set the number of arrays in your kernel
	so you don't have to worry about it again.
	(b) "modification point 2": to add an entry point for your kernel and set
	its arguments.
(4) Visit the Makefile to set your enviroment.
